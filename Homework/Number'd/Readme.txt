Hi, Mr. Winnie, 

Sorry for late assignment turn in. I was absent on last Wednesday and you exntended the Number'd assignment deadline for me. 
Here is the assignment. For the extra credit part I though we don't need to print them out therefore, I did not add the sout section. 
If it is needed, I would change it right a way. Thank you again for the extension. See you tomorrow. 

Sincerely, 
Amber
